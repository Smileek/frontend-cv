This is a source code for my homepage (https://smileek.ru)

Nothing really serious or helpful, just some code to show that I am able to write it.

There are three versions of the same thing using jQuery, Vue.js and ReactJS. You can run them locally, all the necessary files included (even Babel). Although ReactJS version requires a local web server because it triggers a CORS policy error if launched as a `file://`. `npx serve` works just fine.
